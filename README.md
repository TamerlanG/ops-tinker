## 🧪 Development

The project is structured as follows:

```
src/
├── app/                    # Next.js app directory
│   ├── infrastructure/    # Infrastructure monitoring
│   ├── deployments/      # Deployment management
│   ├── metrics/         # DevOps metrics
│   └── layout.tsx       # Root layout
├── components/           # Reusable components
└── lib/                 # Utilities and helpers
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Currently using mock data for demonstration. To connect with real services:

1. Set up your environment variables in `.env.local`
2. Configure your cloud provider credentials
3. Set up your monitoring stack (Prometheus, etc.)
4. Configure your CI/CD integration

## 📚 Future Improvements

- [ ] Real-time data integration with Kubernetes API
- [ ] Cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure) integration
- [ ] CI/CD platform connections
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] Custom metric collection
- [ ] Alert management
- [ ] Cost monitoring
- [ ] Service dependency visualization
